# Packaging & Installation Troubleshooting

> For contributors: how to diagnose a packaged build (NSIS / portable / win-unpacked)
> that fails to start.
> See also: [Developer guide](2-developer-guide.md), [Architecture overview](1-architecture-overview.md).

## 1. Symptom Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely cause | Where to look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installed app: double-click does nothing, no window, no error dialog | Corrupted main-process file inside `app.asar` (most common) | Section 2 |
| Dev mode (`npm run dev`) works, packaged build does not | `out/` was written concurrently during packaging | Sections 2 & 4 |
| Installed app exits quickly, no WER crash record in Event Viewer | Main-process JS syntax error (graceful exit code 1) | Diagnostic commands in Section 2 |
| "Entry point not found" DLL error dialog | Missing runtime / incomplete artifact | Check top-level DLLs in `win-unpacked` |

> A failed packaged app usually leaves **no logs at all**: `snowLog` writes via the Rust
> `writeAppLog` into SQLite, but the process dies before logging initializes, so neither
> `~/.snow/log` nor the app log table has any record.
> Key signal: the process exits within seconds with code `1` (Node/Electron default exit
> code for uncaught exceptions).

## 2. Case Study: v0.1.16 packaged build would not start (2026-08-05)

### 2.1 Symptoms

- `npm run build:win` succeeded (both NSIS and portable were produced);
- After install, double-clicking `Snow App.exe`: no window, no error, process vanishes
  within seconds (exit code 1);
- `npm run dev` worked perfectly.

### 2.2 Root cause

`out/main/index.js` inside `release/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar` was **corrupted**
(truncated tail; `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'`). Electron fails to parse the main
process module at startup → process exits with code 1.

Cause: **`out/` was being written concurrently while packaging ran** (dev mode and the
packaging build both write `out/main/index.js`), so electron-builder packed a half-written
file into `app.asar`.

Key evidence chain:

- Read the real bytes inside the asar with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` and compared the hash
  against the local `out/main/index.js` — they differed;
- `import()` of the asar's main-process file threw `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'`
  (the local file parsed fine);
- Swapping the 0.1.15 `app.asar` into the 0.1.16 `win-unpacked` made the app start
  normally → the problem was the asar content.

### 2.3 Fix

1. Stop all dev processes (e.g. `Get-Process electron | Stop-Process -Force` — do not kill
   the CLI's own process);
2. Delete `out/` (`Remove-Item out -Recurse -Force`);
3. Re-run `npm run build:win`;
4. Verify the new artifact starts (Section 3).

## 3. Verifying a Packaged Build Starts

### 3.1 Process liveness test (fastest)

```powershell
$p = Start-Process -FilePath "release\win-unpacked\Snow App.exe" -PassThru
Start-Sleep -Seconds 15
if (Get-Process -Id $p.Id -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { "ALIVE" } else { "DEAD" }
Stop-Process -Id $p.Id -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

A healthy app shows ~4 `Snow App` processes (main + renderer + GPU + utility), and files
under `%APPDATA%\snow-app` (e.g. `Local Storage`, `Preferences`) get updated.

### 3.2 Main-process file integrity (locate the corrupted file)

```powershell
$env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE = "1"
& "node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe" -e "const fs=require('fs'),c=require('crypto');
  const a='release/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar';
  const b=fs.readFileSync(a+'/out/main/index.js');
  const l=fs.readFileSync('out/main/index.js');
  console.log('asar:', c.createHash('md5').update(b).digest('hex'), b.length);
  console.log('local:', c.createHash('md5').update(l).digest('hex'), l.length);
  console.log('identical:', b.equals(l));"
```

- `identical: false` with equal sizes → the asar file is corrupted or was read while
  being written;
- Go further: `import()` the asar's file from a temp dir containing
  `{"type":"module"}` `package.json` to validate syntax.

### 3.3 Exit code

```powershell
node -e "const {spawn}=require('child_process');
  const p=spawn('release/win-unpacked/Snow App.exe',['--version'],{stdio:['ignore','pipe','pipe']});
  p.on('exit',c=>console.log('exit',c))"
```

`--version` should print `v37.x.x` and exit 0; exit 1 with no output means the main
process failed during module loading.

## 4. Prevention

1. **Always stop dev mode before packaging**: `npm run dev` and `npm run build:win` must
   not run at the same time — both write `out/`, and concurrent writes can corrupt the
   main-process bundle;
2. Clean `out/` before packaging (`Remove-Item out -Recurse -Force`) so the artifact comes
   from this build only;
3. Note that packaging may include uncommitted changes — `git log -1 --format="%ci"`
   shows when the current commit was made;
4. Run the startup check in Section 3 before releasing.

## 5. Diagnostic Tool Caveats

- **Do not rely on `@electron/asar`'s `extractAll` / `extractFile` for integrity checks**:
  for some files (especially top-level files and unpacked entries) it reads wrong offsets
  or stubs, which is misleading;
- `getRawHeader`'s `offset` values are **relative** (relative to the data region), so
  reading raw bytes by offset also yields wrong content;
- Reliable way: `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 electron.exe -e "require('fs').readFileSync('app.asar/<path>')"`
  (Electron's `fs` natively supports asar paths and returns the exact bytes the app loads).
